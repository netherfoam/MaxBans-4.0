/**
 * Version 1.1 for MySQL didn't work on MySQL 5.7 since it used Timestamp values of 0 instead of now() as defaults.
 * Hence the migration was never applied for some people, but it was applied successfully for others. This is part
 * of the workaround that fixes that issue.
 *
 * It "fixes" the checksum of version 1.1 to the expected value forcibly, before validation, so that no exception is
 * triggered when Flyway would otherwise notice that the migration script has been modified after it was applied.
